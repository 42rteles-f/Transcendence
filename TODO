Google client (mine at least) never has the socket initialized when I try to acces tournaments, have to refresh

frontend console error:
    Socket not initialized
    3Socket.ts:75 Socket not initialized

Toast error:
    Cannot distructure propperty 'ok'
    '(intermediate vlaue)' as undefined

Backend:
    does not recive anything


TODO:
- Fix google sign in error
- Fix /pong/tournament bug of having the tournamentHub above the game
- Properly handle no ongoing tournament
- Make db calls after torunament is created, status and finishes
- Check for edge cases
